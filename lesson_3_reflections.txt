When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to share and collaborate with others.  Also if you are working on different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may be working on a feature that is dependant on the working copy of the code and other people may have updated the remote and may introduce bugs into what you are working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork clones a GitHub repository to another GitHub account.
    Cloning clones any repository (GitHub or local) to your local machine.
    Branches creates a new head on a local repository.
    Fork is good for starting on something that someone has shared.
    Cloning is good for doing things on your local machine.
    Branching is good for working on things on your local machine.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can test merges locally and being offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You would have to send each other code changes and try merging at specific times and making sure people are working on the most current version.
    It would be easier to merge more large program changes since you would know how it works and not let Git try and figure it out.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If you are working on fixing a bug or wanting to explore or add a new feature, I would branch.  This allows the working version to stay the same in the event the new features being worked on affect the working version.
